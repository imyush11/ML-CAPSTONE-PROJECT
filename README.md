# ML-CAPSTONE-PROJECT


In the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction ML Project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis and modeling approach to predict the demand for bike-sharing services. The project commenced with thorough data cleaning and manipulation to ensure the dataset's integrity and usability. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing any inconsistencies. Following this, I engaged in data visualization to gain insights into the data, using various charts and plots to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

Hypothesis testing was conducted to validate assumptions and uncover significant relationships between variables, which guided the subsequent feature engineering process. During feature engineering and data preprocessing, I created new relevant features and transformed existing ones to enhance the dataset's predictive power. This included normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and managing feature scaling to optimize the models' performance.

Feature selection was performed to identify the most influential variables, reducing dimensionality and improving model efficiency. With the refined dataset, I implemented multiple machine learning regression models, to predict bike-sharing demand. Each model's performance was evaluated using accuracy scores and other relevant metrics.

After comparing these models, I selected the one with the highest accuracy and best overall performance for deployment. This rigorous approach ensured that the final model was not only accurate but also robust and reliable in predicting bike-sharing demand. Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in the end-to-end process of machine learning model development, from initial data handling to final model selection.
